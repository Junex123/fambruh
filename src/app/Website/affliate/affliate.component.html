          <div>

          <h3><a class="border-top" href="#">Can I become an affiliate if I live outside of the United States?</a></h3>
          <div>
            <p>Yes. We accept affiliates from anywhere in the world, as long as ShareASale supports your country of residence. Note: sizzix.com only ships to the United States.</p>

          <h3><a class="border-top" href="#">How do I sign up?</a></h3>
          <div>
            <p>The Sizzix Affiliate Program is administered through ShareASale, our third-party affiliate network. To join, you must first become a member of the ShareASale Affiliate Network. You can join both our program and ShareASale network in one step here. There is no cost to join or fees associated with the Sizzix Affiliate Program. Quick Tip: Use an email address that matches the website in your profile (i.e. marywebsite.com and www.website.com) to process your application quicker.</p>
            <p>Once your application has been received, you will receive a confirmation email via ShareASale. If you do not receive this email, please check your spam folder. Once approved, you will receive a welcome email from Sizzix.</p>

          <h3><a class="border-top" href="#">How do I get links or banners to Sizzix?</a></h3>
          <div>
            <p>After you apply and are accepted to our Affiliate Program, visit the Sizzix ShareASale Affiliate Page. There, you can browse through the library of text and banner links. Navigate to “Get Links” and click "Get a link/banner." Look for Sizzix, then click "Get Link", which is located below our company name. When you add a text link, banner or product to your website, it will be tagged with your unique affiliate ID. There is neither a minimum nor any limit to how many links or banners you should place on your website. We have found that posting a creative banner along with a text link improves click-through and conversion rates.</p>
